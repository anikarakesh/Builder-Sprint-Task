Builder Sprint Task
Objective: Deliver a pixel-perfect, component-driven, and AI-augmented frontend for a
high-priority module of our real estate platform.
This sprint tests not just how you ship UI — but how you think, leverage AI tools, and build
with intent under tight constraints. We expect to complete the assigned module within the
estimated time window (4–6 hours max). We want to observe how you actively leverage AI
to increase velocity and quality. Please log your usage briefly in the README.

Project Overview
You are tasked with developing a key module of a real estate management platform. This
platform enables the internal team to onboard verified builders, manage property listings,
handle buyer leads, and monitor platform performance.
The goal of this task is to assess your ability to:
● Translate Figma designs into high-fidelity, accessible UI
● Build with modularity, scalability, and performance in mind
● Identify opportunities to use AI tools to accelerate development
● Make clear decisions, fast — and document them where relevant
