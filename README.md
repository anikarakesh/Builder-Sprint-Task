# Timeline

**4:12 PM** – Saw the email while chilling in Third Wave  
**4:47 PM** – Ordered a latte  
**4:55 PM** – Initializing Next.js and going through everything  
**7:00 PM** – Added the basic layout and all functionality, and trying to improve the UI  

I only used Cursor as the AI tool, the reason being I have a premium account with access to premium models and unlimited use.  

From the limited availability I tried to make it as good as possible, but I’m not happy with it.  

**Note:** Wasted around 45 minutes due to vibe coding where colors were not showing (everything was black and white). Then I figured out `var` was required to be prepended to already defined colors in the `global.css` file.  

Did not code anything—everything was vibe coded. I actually stopped working on UI for the past two years, so I just cooked up something with Cursor.  

_End of one work session._
